                <p>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.</p>
                <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.</p>
                <p>Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</p>
                <p>Java is a full-fledged programming language that is compiled to bytecode and runs on a virtual machine.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage.</p>
                <p>Java is used mainly for developing standalone applications, server-side applications, and Android mobile apps.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is used mainly for web development.</p>
                <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is used for developing desktop and mobile applications, big data processing, embedded systems, and more.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language.</p>
                <p>Java is a server-side programming language.</p>
                <code>
                    function sayHello() {

                <p>Python and Ruby are both high-level, interpreted programming languages that are widely used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>
                <p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, and its design philosophy emphasizes code readability and ease of use.</p>
                <p>Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the mid-1990s, and its design philosophy emphasizes programmer productivity and fun.</p>
                <p>Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of learning.</p>
                <p>Ruby is known for its expressiveness, flexibility, and elegance.</p>
                <p>Python is used by many big companies, such as Google, Facebook, Dropbox, and Spotify.</p>
                <p>Ruby is used by many startups, such as Airbnb, GitHub, Shopify, and Twitch.</p>
                <p>Python has a large and active community, and a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools.</p>
                <p>Ruby has a smaller but passionate community, and a rich ecosystem of gems and frameworks.</p>
                <p>Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing to machine learning.</p>
                <p>Ruby is a language that is optimized for programmer happiness, and is often used for web development and scripting.</p>

                <p>HTML and CSS are the building blocks of the web.</p>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and is used for creating the structure and content of a webpage.</p>
                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is used for styling the appearance of a webpage.</p>
                <p>HTML and CSS are both declarative languages, which means that you describe what you want to achieve, and the browser figures out how to do it.</p>
                <p>HTML is a markup language that consists of a series of tags, which are used to define the structure and content of a webpage.</p>
                <p>CSS is a style sheet language that consists of a series of rules, which are used to define the appearance of a webpage.</p>
                <p>HTML and CSS are both platform-independent, which means that they can be used on any device that has a web browser.</p>
                <p>HTML and CSS are both easy to learn, and are the first languages that most web developers learn.</p>
                <p>HTML and CSS are constantly evolving, and new features are being added all the time.</p>

                                    <p>Responsive design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.</p>
                                    <p>Responsive design uses a combination of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries.</p>
                                    <p>Responsive design is important because it ensures that your website looks good and is easy to use on all devices, from smartphones to tablets to desktops.</p>
                                    <p>Responsive design is also important for search engine optimization (SEO), because it helps your website rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
                                    <p>Responsive design is a relatively new concept, but it has quickly become the standard for modern web design.</p>
